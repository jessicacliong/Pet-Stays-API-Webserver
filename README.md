### R1 and R2 Problem Identification and Justification

The problem being solved by this application is the need for a secure method pet owners can create personal accounts with a pet sitter company, pet sitters can inform owners with matters regarding their loved ones while away from them, organise drop offs and pick ups with the pet sitters when to pick up their pets. An account system serves useful for customers to separate pet matters from personal ones as pet sitters can also access personal information about the pets in order to provide better personalised care for each pet's individual needs, while it also serves as a location for direct update of contact details for customer's convenience.

Future iterations of this application will allow customers to send messages to pet sitters and enable the communication services to be a two-way direction service instead of just a one-way service. 

### R3 Justification of the Database System

There are many database management systems available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, suited for different situations. To ensure the most appropriate type of database management system was used for this application, an analysis was done to study all the different alternative options. An analysis of the chosen system was developed and is shown below in Table 1 and 2.  

#### Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
#### PostgreSQL Database Management

### R4 Functionalities and Benefits of an ORM
### R5 API Endpoints
### R7 Third Party Services

#### SQLAlchemy
#### Psycopg2
#### Flask-Marshmallow
#### Python-Dotenv
#### Flask-Bcrypt
#### Flask-JWT-Extended

### R10 Project Planning and Tracking Tasks

#### Creating a Trello Board

Trello was used to keep track of the development process of this project. The trello board was divided into 5 categories:

1. Backlog - A list of tasks I would like to do for the project. This was where the brainstorming of the project ideas were listed, elaborated and prioritised by importance. All the specifications of the project was thought through and listed down, even if it was not implemented in the project. I was aware of the time restrictions and the labour restrictions of the project, hence wanted to list down all of the tasks to pick which ones to prioritise on. In the future, I would like to add an additional feature where the users can also send messages to the reply to Staff messages and allow users to create ratings on Staff performance while caring for their pets. 
2. To-Do - A list of prioritised planned work to be completed
3. Doing - Tasks that are currently being worked on. I was able to focus on what needs to be done for the day by listing the tasks in this section and store ongoing tasks as a daily reminder to tick off, such as keeping an ongoing list of references. 
4. Testing - Completed tasks that are yet to be tested/reviewed
5. Done - Completed Tasks

I began the project by creating the Trello board for this project using the Kanban template available in the set templates list. 

 
### User Story Utilisation

After creating the preliminary tasks, this helped me determine the key tasks required to create this application. Each short explanations outlined a specific user need outlining what each role was, what action needed to be performed and why. Following the agile methodology, they were expressed through user perspective and were used to help establish tasks to be completed. These user stories informed me as a developer of what data and information needs to be stored in the database, the routes/end points required to be made (Agile Alliance, 2022). This ensures the application delivered the highest value to the end user by ensuring the core needs were met and end users were kept in mind as a priority.  
In future projects, I would write this before writing the problem documentation and creating an ERD for the project.

### Prioritisation, Timeframes and Labels

After writing user stories, I wrote a checklist of tasks to be completed for each user story. Every checklist was ensured the tasks were specific, achieveable and actionable by my current programming capabilities. I assigned dates to the tasks to be done, prioritised each task and assigned labels to keep track of the categories these tasks fall into, also to bookmark each task, such as either categorising them as a README, coding, planning or userstory task. 


### Adding Assessable Elements

I also added tasks to be completed that needed to meet assesment requirements outlined in the rubric. This allowed me to mark tasks as complete as I progressed through the assignment and know which outstanding tasks are needed to complete before the deadline.
